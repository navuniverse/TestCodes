 * Package to show the functionality of Abstract Factory pattern.
 * Abstract Factory patterns works around a super-factory which creates 
 * other factories. This factory is also called as Factory of factories. 
 * This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this 
 * pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Abstract 
 * Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of 
 * related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes. Each 
 * generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
