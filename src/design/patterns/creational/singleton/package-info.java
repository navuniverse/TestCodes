 * Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns 
 * in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational 
 * pattern as this pattern provides one of the best way to 
 * create an object. This pattern involves a single class which 
 * is responsible to creates own object while making sure that 
 * only single object get created. This class provides a way to 
 * access its only object which can be accessed directly without 
 * need to instantiate the object of the class.
